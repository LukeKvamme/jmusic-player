# jmusic-player

A Java .mp3 player using Maven with JavaFX and Mp3agic dependencies.

This is a very basic application that searches the user's music folder in Windows to display and play .mp3 files.

JavaFX is used for the GUI and playing of the actual .mp3 file, while Mp3agic is used to parse the .mp3 metadata to obtain the tag type and tag data for displaying of the song, length, and photo (*if included*).
